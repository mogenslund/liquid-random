# Liquid Random
Instead of providing an extensions for Liquid, which requires 30 lines of configuration,
I will just provide you the 30 lines of code for you to adjust to your needs!

This repo is for snippets that almost works as extensions Liquid. Just copy a adjust.
That will give you 100% flexibility.
